# Integrating MCP Server into Cursor Window (2025-02-24 08:53:54)

How woul I add this mcp server to my cursor window?

---

_**Assistant**_

To add the MCP server to your cursor window, you typically need to modify the configuration files or scripts that manage the cursor window's behavior. However, the specific steps can vary based on the context of your application and how the cursor window is implemented.

Assuming you want to integrate the MCP server into a Python application, you might need to update the `__init__.py` file to include the server's initialization or configuration. Here's a general approach:

1. **Import the MCP server**: Ensure that you import the necessary modules or classes from your MCP server.
2. **Initialize the server**: Add the server initialization code in the appropriate place in your application.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might modify the `__init__.py` file:

### Update to `src/fastmcp_todo_server/__init__.py`
```python:src/fastmcp_todo_server/__init__.py
# existing imports...
from fastmcp import MCPServer  # Import your MCP server

def start_server():
    server = MCPServer()  # Initialize the MCP server
    server.start()  # Start the server

# existing code...
```

### Explanation
- **Import the MCP server**: This line imports the `MCPServer` class from your MCP module.
- **Initialize and start the server**: The `start_server` function creates an instance of the MCP server and starts it.

If you need to add specific configurations or handle events related to the cursor window, please provide more details about how your cursor window is set up, and I can give more tailored advice.

does the other server.run() do something diffrent?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, the `server.run()` method and the `start_server()` function you added serve different purposes and are likely part of different server implementations.

### Explanation of the Two Methods

1. **`server.run()`**:
   - This method is called within the `TodoServer` class and is designed to run the FastMCP server. It is an asynchronous method that starts the FastMCP server and handles incoming requests.
   - The `run()` method in the `TodoServer` class calls `asyncio.run(self.run_async())`, which is an asynchronous function that starts the FastMCP server using `await self.server.run_stdio_async()`. This means it is designed to handle asynchronous operations, allowing for non-blocking I/O.

2. **`start_server()`**:
   - This is a new function you added that initializes and starts an instance of the `MCPServer`. It is a synchronous function that creates a new server instance and starts it.
   - If you call `start_server()`, it will run the `MCPServer` in a blocking manner, which means it will not return control until the server is stopped.

### Key Differences
- **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous**: The `run()` method is asynchronous and designed to work with the FastMCP framework, while `start_server()` is synchronous and starts a different server (MCPServer).
- **Server Type**: They are likely different server implementations, and they may not be compatible with each other. If you are using FastMCP, you would typically want to use the `run()` method to handle requests properly.

### Conclusion
If you are integrating the MCP server into your application, you need to decide which server you want to run based on your application's requirements. If you want to use both servers, you may need to manage their execution carefully to avoid conflicts, especially if they are meant to handle similar tasks or resources.
